# Multivariate-Regression-Analysis


## Overview
This theoretical project aims to predict construction hoist project times using multivariate regression. Developed as part of university research at Technische Hochschule Ostwestfalen-Lippe (TH-OWL), the analysis focuses on parameters like weight lifted, scaffold height, and scaffold length. The dataset used was generated by AI, and the project is not affiliated with Kewazo.

## Important Note
This project is entirely theoretical and was developed for academic purposes. No data from Kewazo was used, and the project is not affiliated with or endorsed by Kewazo.

## Usage
Run the script and input the total weight, scaffold height, and scaffold length to predict the project time.


## Repository Contents
- `Multilinear_regression.py`: Python script for regression analysis.
- `project_data_20.09.csv`: Dataset used for analysis.
- `multilinear_regression_theory.pdf`: Theoretical framework and methodology.


## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/lifbot-regression-analysis.git
   cd lifbot-regression-analysis
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
   ```

3. **Run the Script**
   Execute the script to perform the regression analysis:
   ```bash
   python lifbot_analysis.py
   ```



## Results
The model’s performance is evaluated using the R² score, and results are visualized to illustrate the fit of the model to the data.
